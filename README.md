# ft_strlowcase


Welcome to the `ft_strlowcase` function repository. This utility provides an efficient means of transforming any uppercase letters within a string to lowercase. It's an invaluable tool for text processing, ensuring uniformity in case for strings where lowercase presentation is required.

## Description

`ft_strlowcase` receives a single argument: a pointer to a character string. It proceeds to examine each character, converting those in the range of uppercase alphabetic characters (`'A'` to `'Z'`) to their lowercase counterparts (`'a'` to `'z'`) by adjusting their ASCII values. This transformation is essential for applications requiring case-insensitive handling of text data.
